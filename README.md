# OPIS:
# This project models the rebellion of a subjugated population 
# against a central authority. It is is an adaptation of Joshua 
# Epstein's model of civil violence (2002).

# The population wanders around randomly. 
# If their level of grievance against the central 
# authority is high enough, and their perception of the risks
# involved is low enough, they openly rebel. A separate population of 
# police officers ("cops"), acting on behalf of the central authority, 
# seeks to suppress the rebellion. The cops wander around randomly and 
# arrest people who are actively rebelling.
